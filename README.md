# Java Lab Cycle 

## Questions 

1. Program to display two numbers using command line arguments, add those numbers, and display the result.
2. Write a program to perform the mathematical operations using switch case.
3. Keep a secret number between 20 and 30 in your program. Ask the user to
predict a number between 20 and 30. Use a do-while loop until the user predicts
your secret number and displays the count of attempts.
4. Implement searching and sorting elements in an Array.
5. Implement a Java program to pass an array in different ways.
6. Write a Java program to add and multiply two matrices.
7. A function takes two integer arguments and returns the maximum. Use this function
to find the maximum of three numbers.
8. A function takes an integer argument and returns the reverse of the same. Another
function takes an integer argument and returns true or false if the number is a
palindrome, using the above function.
9. The 15-puzzle (also known as the sliding puzzle) consists of a 4×4 grid containing 15
numbered tiles (from 1 to 15) and one empty space. The objective is to rearrange the
tiles by sliding them horizontally or vertically into the empty space to achieve the
correct ascending order, as shown below: [Experiential Learning]

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 _          incomplete
10. Display from n - 1 and 1-n using recursive functions.
